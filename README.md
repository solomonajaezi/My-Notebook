ON LINUX

What is Linux
Linus is an operating system that sits in the middle of your hardware and users. Linux is an open source computer operating system, initially developed on and for Intel x86-based personal computers. It has been subsequently ported to an astoundingly long list of other hardware platforms, from tiny embedded appliances to the world's largest supercomputers.

Linux powers more than half of the servers on the Internet, the majority of smartphones (via the Android system, which is built on top of Linux), more than 90 percent of the public cloud workload, and all of the world’s most powerful supercomputers.

Linus Distribution Family
The families and representative distributions we are using are: 
• Red Hat Family Systems (including CentOS and Fedora)
• SUSE Family Systems (including openSUSE)
• Debian Family Systems (including Ubuntu and Linux Mint)

Why Distribution
People see a need, and develop special configurations and utilities to respond to that need. Sometimes that effort creates a whole new distribution of Linux. Sometimes, that effort will leverage an existing distribution to expand the members of an existing family!
